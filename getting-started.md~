ShellHub is built using the microservices design pattern, meaning that
multiple small, isolated services make up the server.
In order to make it easy to test ShellHub as a whole, we have created
a Docker Compose environment that brings all of these components up
and connects them together on a single machine.

## Installing

Before continuing, make sure you have installed Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

In a working directory, download the docker-compose file:

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellhub-io/shellhub/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Brings up the ShellHub server:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Creating the initial user

After ShellHub server have been up and running you need to create the initial user.

Go to the working directory and download the `add-user` utility from our repository:

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellhub-io/shellhub/master/bin/add-user
```

Then run the `add-user` utility:

```
$ sh ./add-user <username> <password>
```

## Adding your first device

```
$ docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped --privileged --net=host --pid=host -v /:/host -e SERVER_ADDRESS=http://localhost -e PRIVATE_KEY=/host/etc/shellhub.key -e TENANT_D=<TENANT-ID> shellhubio/agent:latest
```

> Note that you have to replace `<TENANT-ID>` with your Tenant ID.

## Connecting to your device

To connect to your device you need to know its `SSHID` address.

Open the ShellHub UI at http://localhost and sign in using the username and password
that was generated in a previous step.

[Example](https://example.com){target=_blank}

Once you had sign in go to [Device Fleet](http://localhost/devices){target=_blank} page and copy the the device's `SSHID`.
